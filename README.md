Road designers must cope with the trade-off between less resource to construct for
builders of the road and less fuel to consume for users of the road, as both of them consume
resources of our globe, they must be more than careful to find the best place between these
two ends.
In this project, you do not need to cope with this optimization but you are supposed to
analyze advantageous and disadvantageous sides of both ends. Your task consists of three core
steps. The first step is designing an algorithm that finds fastest route in terms of distance in
given road-map, the second step is designing an algorithm that designs the roads (by selecting
the existing ones) such that points (such as cities, villages, countries etc.) are barely connected
which means there is no cycle such that you can end at the point that you have been started
(which means without using any road that is already passed). The last step is analysis of
these two approaches, you have to report the differences as reporting the construction material
amount difference between given map and the map that you have created; and fastest route
difference between the given map and yours in terms of distance that traveler wend.
